#### Notes
> The political nature of search demonstrates how algorithms are a fundamental invention of computer scientists who are human beings - and code is a language full of meaning and applied in varying ways to different types of information.

> Helen Nissenbaum, a professor of media, culture, and communication and computer science at New York University, has written with Lucas Introna, a professor of organization, technology, and ethics at the Lancaster University Management School, about how search engines bias information toward the most powerful online. Their work was corroborated by Alejandro Diaz, who wrote his dissertation at Stanford on sociopolitical bias in Google's products. Kate Crawford and Tarleton Gillespie, two researchers at Microsoft Research New England, have written extensively about algorithmic bias, and Crawford recently coorganized a summit with the White House and New York University for academics, industry, and activists concerned with the social impact of artificial intelligence in society. 

> YouTube promotional algorithms (Recommended, Suggested, Related, Search, MetaScore, etc.) simply as "the YouTube algorithm"

> Watchtime is a combination of: views, view duration, session starts, upload frequency, session duration, session ends.
