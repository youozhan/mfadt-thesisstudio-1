[Walk With Me](https://github.com/nathanvogel/walk-with-me)

*Walk With Me* is an augmented reality application that visualizes the activities from two different places. By using telepresence, we want to give the audience the feeling of being in a combined space of both locations. It is a collaborative project between Parsons Paris and ECAL. 

We finished the first two design stages in the spring 2018 semester. We created a 2D footprint and an animation of footprint walking. The user will start the experience with entering a room or standing in an open space. The user will then be able to see the other users by tracking their footprints. 

The most important design point to solve is the interaction when two people "meet". We wanted to design the experience as a real-time shared action, to share some environmental information and help the audience feel more connected. Therefore, during the summer, we developed a messaging interface for the user to send immediate thought via the interface. The messages will be floating in the air of the combined space. We also added an on-boarding interface and an empty-room interface as an enhancement of the overall workflow.
