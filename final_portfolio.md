#### Abstract
Algorithms have been participating in the majority of the human's daily activities. More and more decision-making processes have been replaced by algorithm processing. However, little attention has been paid to regulating the behavior of an algorithm-controlled system as what being regulated of a human. This thesis project is looking at the impact of the algorithm to its direct users in the daily circumstances. More specifically, it is asking the question of how algorithm being transparent can make a difference to this impact. It experiments with bringing the dynamics inside the algorithm-controlled system outside and testing the experiences. The research also consists of the study of academic and legal responses to algorithmic transparency.

By choosing YouTube video publishing as the main focused area, and by presenting to both the viewers and creative content publishers of this platform, this project intends to model the unseen connections and dynamics inside of an iconic digital platform that closely connected with a large group of Internet users. To further manifest this idea, two networked thermal printers are constructed with Raspberry Pi, thermal printer guts, and acrylic boards, and two templates of receipts are designed and printed as if the digital contents within the black box are tangible. This opens the door for the audience to rethink about the process and question the ignorance.

#### Thesis concept, questions, goal
This thesis project is looking at how the algorithmic transparency is affecting the everyday lives and what are the current academic and legal reactions addressing this problem. The goal of this project would be to present an experience that models the dynamics in an algorithm controlled system and the necessity of the algorithmic transparency.

#### Research
The research is based on the domain of algorithmic transparency and the sub-domains including algorithm-controlled systems, policy and ethics, security and Intellectual Property, and the main characteristics of the algorithm related to transparency. Algorithms are developed to solve a problem or complete a task. While we are enjoying the optimized world coming from algorithms, algorithms are controlling everything we see and do on the Internet. Digital platforms are producing "a harmonization of tastes" across the world. Facebook can conduct a study of emotional contagion based on a total number of 689.003 users. 80s Japanese enthusiasts can use YouTube's recommendation algorithm to share their interests and make "Plastic Love" an enormous hit. YouTube's top creators can work for the algorithms and have to claim burning out. 

Nicholas Diakopoulos and Michael Koliska coined the phrase and defined algorithmic transparency as "the disclosure of information about algorithms to enable monitoring, checking, criticism, or intervention by interested parties". Kate Crawford from AI Now Institute and Viadan Joler from Share Lab created an anatomical map of Amazon Echo. MIT Lincoln Laboratory is working on setting up a new standard for the algorithm to make the Artificial Intelligence system use human-like reasoning to solve problems. EU Commission relates data protection law as part of the rights of citizens. Regardless of where the data is processed and where the company is established, one has the right to obtain access to the personal data held, to request the decisions based on automated processing concerning, and to express the point of view and contest the decision.
