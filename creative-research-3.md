#### Research Summary
This thesis research is looking at how the algorithm not being transparent is affecting our everyday life and what are the current academic and legal strategies that act against this problem. The response to this topic would be to create a speculative design that pictures a fictional world that either eliminates the problem or the problem never exits.

Michael Johnston from Colgate University defined "Transparency" as "official business conducted in such a way that substantive and procedural information is available to, and broadly understandable by, people and groups in society, subject to reasonable limits protecting security and privacy" in an article [1].

In 2014, researchers from Facebook and Cornell University conducted a study of emotional contagion based on a random sample of Facebook users over a one-week period in 2012. It caused a heated discussion on ethics, legal policy, and psychological test standard. [2] In 2018, top creators from YouTube reported that the burning out and breaking down issue is spreading. [3] *Algorithm of Oppression* using Google search algorithm as an example, points out that the algorithm reflects the biases and values among a large group, in which minorities can be rarely noticed [4]. From Wall Street to Silicon Valley, the algorithmic control has gone beyond the money and information and penetrate into every aspect of the everyday life [5]. Technology companies generally use claims of secrecy in the objection. In China, due to the core data advantage in the sheer size of China's population and the privacy laws allowing a free-for-all with user data, the real-world activities of Chinese people are all captured and used for AI algorithm development.

Kate Crawford from AI Now Institute and Viadan Joler from Share Lab created an anatomical map of Amazon Echo. Although the general audience often views the system and the interaction just as a combination of commands and responses, there are more underneath - chains of resource extraction, human labor, algorithmic processing, and logistics. [7] The workshop on VIsualization for AI Explainability at IEEE VIS uses visualization to illustrate how AI techniques work. [8] Also, MIT Lincoln Laboratory is working on setting up a new standard for the algorithm to make the Artificial Intelligence system use human-like reasoning to solve problems. [9]

New York City Council met early on a law on algorithmic decision-making transparency. It could have real significance for the rest of the nation. New York is using the algorithm to determine the bail value for indigent defendants.  As AI is pervasive throughout the world, artificial intelligence and big data analytics are increasingly replacing human decision making. [10] EU Commission relates data protection law as part of the rights of citizens. Regardless of where the data is processed and where the company is established, one has the right to obtain access to the personal data held,  to request that decisions based on automated processing concerning, to express the point of view and contest the decision.
