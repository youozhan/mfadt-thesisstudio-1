#### Process + Mechanics
Arduino code [sketch_oct04a.ino](Code/sketch_oct18a.ino)

The Arduino will instruct the thermal printer to print a pre-programmed message when a digital input is detected.

#### User Test Questions
* How frequent do you use YouTube?
* What does the prototype make you think of?
* For what scenario?
* What information do you think is the most important? Why?

#### Reflection
* “Goal of algorithm”
* See it explicitly
* Access the service
* Specifics
* Form of bill/receipt
* Compromise, “failure on me”, like the convenience, complicated
* Layers of information
* Threshold
* Effective - analog form
* Not effective enough - understanding the information
