#### Precedents
1. [Sorting â€“ Visualisation, sortification and sonification of an algorithm](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/sorting-visualisation-sortification-and-sonification-of-an-algorithm/)

    *Sorting* is an algorithm visualization and sonification. It visualized the features of sorting and made the algorithms of sorting audible. It communicated the world of code with visual and sound which are more "sensible".
