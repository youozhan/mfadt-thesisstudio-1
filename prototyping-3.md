#### Form (3rd Iteration)

There are three formats being tested in this prototype. The first one tries to explain the details of search history by presenting the search queries from the data downloaded in my Google account. The second one elaborates the details of ad profiling of me based on my personal info and Google's estimation of my interests.

#### Reflection
* The connection between "Sleep no more" with recommendation algorithms
* The different treatment in Europe. Ad-supported digital publishers tried various approaches to convince ad blocker users to disable the software and pay for ad-free access to content.
