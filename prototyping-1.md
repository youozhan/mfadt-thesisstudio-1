#### Concept
My thesis research is looking at how the algorithmic transparency is affecting the everyday lives and what are the current academic and legal reactions addressing this problem. 

Through the prototyping, I am planning to create an experience that models the dynamics in an algorithm controlled system and reflects the necessity of the algorithmic transparency.

#### Intention
Keywords: unboxing, dynamics

The first prototype is about creating a workflow that asks the audience to actively request for the disclosure of the mechanics within an algorithm-controlled system. Here I used a button, a mini thermal printer, and the YouTube video watching system. Once the audience presses the button, a piece of paper will be printed out stating the input/output, the process, and the goal of YouTube algorithms.

#### Material
- Soft circuit button
- Mini thermal printer
- Arduino Uno
- Wires

#### Process + Mechanics
Arduino code [sketch_oct04a.ino](Code/sketch_oct04a.ino)

The Arduino will instruct the thermal printer to print a pre-programmed message when a digital input is detected.

#### Reflection
* Layer of information: There are three processes here. The audience uses YouTube as a context. The device prints the algorithmic information as the main process. In addition, the audience needs to comprehend the information.
* Group of audience: Who would like to dig into the information and why does him/her press the button?
* Physical setup: Why is it a printed material? What happened before using it or around it?
* The tone of the device: Is it meant to be funny?
